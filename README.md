# Microservices-deployment-on-Kubernetes.
Cloud-Native Application on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Using Docker, CI/CD, and Kubernetes

This project demonstrates the development of a cloud-native application on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), utilizing Docker for containerization and CI/CD pipelines for continuous deployment and integration. 

Key features include:

Containerized Applications: All services are containerized using Docker, ensuring consistent environments across development and production.
CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines were built using GCP tools for seamless code deployment, reducing manual intervention and speeding up the development cycle.
Kubernetes Orchestration: The application is deployed on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), managing multiple services through microservices architecture for enhanced scalability and fault tolerance.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform was employed to manage the GCP infrastructure, enabling repeatable and version-controlled deployments.
Reliable Data Storage: Ensured reliable data storage solutions and optimized microservice communication using GCPâ€™s managed services and networking capabilities.
